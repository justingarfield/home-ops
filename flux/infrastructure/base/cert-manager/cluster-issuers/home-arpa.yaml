# This ClusterIssuer is used for internally-facing application ingress endpoints.
#
# I chose not to use LetsEncrypt for ingresses that will never be externally exposed,
# as LetsEncrypt frowns upon cutting certificates for non-public applications.
#
# Note: Requires importing the Intermediate CA to your local device(s) if you don't
#       want to deal with SSL/TLS Certificate Errors when browsing to said ingresses.

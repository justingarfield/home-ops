  # - mayastor.yaml
  # I decided to pass on Mayastor, because it only supports amd64 officially at this point in time.
  # There are unofficial arm64 methods to deploy it out there on the web, but it's not supported.

  # - rook-ceph.yaml
  # Rook-Ceph was my first choice for storage since it also offers S3 Object APIs, but dear god is
  # this thing overly-complex for my current needs and hardware specs. If you decide to try rook-ceph,
  # just know that it expects around 4-CPUs and ~30GB of RAM for the OOTB Requests/Limits. Don't be
  # surprised if the kube-scheduler keeps telling you "Hellz no!" in a desktop lab environment :)
